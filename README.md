## Python Fundamentals

### Variables and Data Types

Variables in Python serve as containers for storing data values. Python uses dynamic typing, meaning you do not need to declare variable types explicitly.

#### Basic Data Types

**Integers** represent whole numbers such as 42, -17, or 0. **Floats** represent decimal numbers like 3.14, -2.5, or 0.0. **Strings** represent text data enclosed in quotes, such as "Hello World" or 'Python'. **Booleans** represent logical values of True or False.

Example usage:
```python
name = "PhuDev"
age = 14
height = 1.65
is_student = True
```

#### Collections

**Lists** are ordered, mutable collections that can contain different data types. Lists use square brackets and allow duplicate values.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed_list = ["hello", 42, True, 3.14]
```

**Tuples** are ordered, immutable collections defined with parentheses. Once created, tuple elements cannot be changed.

```python
coordinates = (10, 20)
rgb_color = (255, 128, 0)
```

**Dictionaries** store data in key-value pairs using curly braces. Keys must be unique and immutable.

```python
student = {
    "name": "PhuDev",
    "age": 14,
    "grade": "9th"
}
```

**Sets** contain unique, unordered elements defined with curly braces.

```python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

### Basic Operations

#### Arithmetic Operations

Python supports standard mathematical operations. Addition uses the plus symbol (+), subtraction uses minus (-), multiplication uses asterisk (*), division uses forward slash (/), floor division uses double forward slash (//), modulus uses percent (%), and exponentiation uses double asterisk (**).

```python
result = 10 + 5    # Addition: 15
result = 10 - 3    # Subtraction: 7
result = 4 * 6     # Multiplication: 24
result = 15 / 3    # Division: 5.0
result = 15 // 4   # Floor division: 3
result = 15 % 4    # Modulus: 3
result = 2 ** 3    # Exponentiation: 8
```

#### String Operations

String concatenation combines multiple strings using the plus operator. String repetition multiplies strings using the asterisk operator.

```python
greeting = "Hello" + " " + "World"  # "Hello World"
repeated = "Python! " * 3           # "Python! Python! Python! "
```

### Input and Output

The `input()` function reads user input as a string. The `print()` function displays output to the console.

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
print(f"Welcome, {name}!")  # f-string formatting
```

### Control Structures

#### Conditional Statements

Conditional statements execute code blocks based on specified conditions. Python uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` keywords for conditional logic.

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
elif age >= 13:
    print("You are a teenager")
else:
    print("You are a child")
```

#### Comparison Operators

Python provides various comparison operators for conditional statements. Equal to uses double equals (==), not equal uses exclamation point equals (!=), greater than uses (>), less than uses (<), greater than or equal uses (>=), and less than or equal uses (<=).

#### Logical Operators

Logical operators combine multiple conditions. The `and` operator requires all conditions to be true. The `or` operator requires at least one condition to be true. The `not` operator reverses the logical state.

```python
temperature = 25
weather = "sunny"

if temperature > 20 and weather == "sunny":
    print("Perfect weather for a picnic!")
```

#### Loops

**For Loops** iterate over sequences like lists, strings, or ranges.

```python
# Iterating over a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"I like {fruit}")

# Using range
for i in range(1, 6):  # 1 to 5
    print(f"Number: {i}")
```

**While Loops** continue executing while a condition remains true.

```python
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(f"Count: {count}")
    count += 1
```

### Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. Functions help organize code and avoid repetition.

```python
def greet_user(name):
    """Function to greet a user"""
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to Python programming!"

def calculate_area(length, width):
    """Calculate rectangle area"""
    area = length * width
    return area

# Using functions
message = greet_user("PhuDev")
print(message)

rectangle_area = calculate_area(5, 3)
print(f"Area: {rectangle_area}")
```

#### Function Parameters

Functions can accept multiple types of parameters. **Default parameters** provide fallback values when arguments are not provided. **Keyword arguments** allow passing arguments by parameter name.

```python
def introduce_student(name, age=14, grade="9th"):
    return f"My name is {name}, I'm {age} years old in {grade} grade"

# Different ways to call the function
print(introduce_student("PhuDev"))
print(introduce_student("PhuDev", 15))
print(introduce_student("PhuDev", grade="10th"))
```

### Error Handling

Error handling prevents programs from crashing when unexpected situations occur. Python uses `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks for exception handling.

```python
try:
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 100 / number
    print(f"Result: {result}")
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number!")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
else:
    print("Calculation completed successfully!")
finally:
    print("Program execution finished.")
```

### File Operations

Python provides built-in functions for reading from and writing to files.

#### Reading Files

```python
try:
    with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
        print(content)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found!")
```

#### Writing Files

```python
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, Python!\n")
    file.write("This is written by PhuDev")
```

### Object-Oriented Programming Basics

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) organizes code using classes and objects. Classes serve as blueprints for creating objects with specific attributes and methods.

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age, grade):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.grade = grade
        self.subjects = []
    
    def add_subject(self, subject):
        self.subjects.append(subject)
    
    def introduce(self):
        return f"Hi, I'm {self.name}, {self.age} years old, in {self.grade} grade"
    
    def show_subjects(self):
        if self.subjects:
            return f"My subjects: {', '.join(self.subjects)}"
        return "No subjects enrolled yet"

# Creating and using objects
student1 = Student("PhuDev", 14, "9th")
student1.add_subject("Mathematics")
student1.add_subject("Python Programming")

print(student1.introduce())
print(student1.show_subjects())
```

## Essential Python Libraries

### Standard Library Modules

Python includes numerous built-in modules that extend functionality without requiring additional installations.

**The `math` module** provides mathematical functions and constants.

```python
import math

print(math.pi)           # 3.141592653589793
print(math.sqrt(16))     # 4.0
print(math.factorial(5)) # 120
```

**The `random` module** generates random numbers and selections.

```python
import random

print(random.randint(1, 10))        # Random integer between 1-10
print(random.choice(['a', 'b', 'c'])) # Random choice from list
```

**The `datetime` module** handles dates and times.

```python
from datetime import datetime, date

current_time = datetime.now()
today = date.today()
print(f"Current time: {current_time}")
print(f"Today's date: {today}")
```

## Best Practices for Python Development

### Code Style and Formatting

Following consistent code style improves readability and maintainability. Use meaningful variable and function names that clearly describe their purpose. Apply consistent indentation using four spaces per level. Keep lines under 79 characters when possible. Add blank lines to separate logical sections of code.

### Comments and Documentation

Write clear comments to explain complex logic or important decisions. Use docstrings for functions, classes, and modules to describe their purpose and usage. Update comments when modifying code to maintain accuracy.

```python
def calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, compounds_per_year=1):
    """
    Calculate compound interest.
    
    Args:
        principal (float): Initial investment amount
        rate (float): Annual interest rate (as decimal)
        time (float): Time period in years
        compounds_per_year (int): Number of times interest compounds per year
    
    Returns:
        float: Final amount after compound interest
    """
    amount = principal * (1 + rate/compounds_per_year) ** (compounds_per_year * time)
    return amount
```

### Error Prevention

Validate user input before processing to prevent runtime errors. Use appropriate data types for different kinds of information. Test edge cases and unusual inputs. Implement proper error handling for file operations and user interactions.
